### Name: Chereen Tam 
### Course Info: Digital Humanities 150 : User Experience Design
### ~Course Description: Introduction to fields of user experience (UX) research and design. Study covers UX design methods and process including ethnographic field research, persona-scenario development, information architecture, prototyping, and usability testing. Students learn--by hands-on practice in human-centered process--how to understand users, design interface and interaction for users, and evaluate and communicate user experience design with users.

#### In this project, I would like to recreate Craigslist and UCLA's Art Departmeent website in order to promote efficiency between the system and the users. By evaluating and understanding the abilities of the website, I will be able to improve the site's functions and userability. 

#### These are the links to the Heuristic evaluation to both the sites:
